This is a beginner-intermediate course that will test my ability to problem solve and troubleshoot independently.

My goal is to complete this course backwards. I've previously been stuck in what's known as tutorial hell. I decided the best way to get out of the cycle is to do this course blindfolded. Essentially, watch the first video for the day to understand the goal, and then just make it happen. It might seem unconventional, but that's not a problem. I'm pushing myself out of my comfort zone, and that seems to be the only way to get myself out of this 3 year rutt.

Follow along as I challenge myself and perhaps motivate you if you find yourself in the same boat!
